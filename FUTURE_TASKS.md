# SwifMetro - Future Tasks

## Tasks for Later (Not Needed Yet)

### 1. Build XCFramework Binary
**Status:** Not started - code verification comes first

**What this does:**
- Compiles the Swift source code into a binary XCFramework
- XCFramework = pre-compiled framework that works on all Apple platforms
- Makes distribution faster (users don't compile from source)

**Why we need it:**
- Faster integration for customers
- Protects source code (binary only)
- Professional distribution method

**Where the source is:**
- `/Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/SwiftMetroTEST/SwifMetro/SwifMetroClient.swift` (788 lines)

**Command to build (when ready):**
```bash
cd /Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/SwiftMetroTEST
swift build -c release
# Then create XCFramework with xcodebuild
```

### 2. NPM Package with License Key System
**Status:** Not started - code verification comes first

**What this does:**
- Creates NPM package for easy installation
- Implements license key validation system
- Allows `npm install swifmetro` instead of GitHub URL

**Why we need it:**
- Professional distribution
- License key enforcement
- Easy updates for customers
- Payment integration with Stripe

**Current license system:**
- Demo key: `SWIF-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO` (7-day trial)
- Production keys: Format `SWIF-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`

**Files involved:**
- SwifMetroClient.swift validates license keys
- Server tracks license usage
- Would need NPM package.json for distribution

---

## Current Priority: Verify All Code Works

Before building binaries or NPM packages, we need to ensure:
- ✅ Server runs correctly (DONE - working perfectly)
- ✅ Dashboard connects (DONE - showing logs)
- ✅ iOS app captures logs (DONE - 100+ logs streaming)
- ✅ Automatic print() capture (DONE - working)
- ⏳ Test all edge cases
- ⏳ Verify license key validation
- ⏳ Test on real device (not just simulator)
- ⏳ Check memory leaks
- ⏳ Performance testing

## Why We're Not Building Yet

**Smart approach:** Make sure everything works perfectly before creating distribution packages.

If we build the XCFramework now and then find a bug later, we'd have to:
1. Fix the bug in source
2. Rebuild the entire XCFramework
3. Re-distribute to customers
4. Customers would need to update

**Better approach:** Test everything thoroughly first, THEN build distribution packages once.

---

## When We're Ready to Build

1. Complete all testing
2. Freeze the code (no more changes)
3. Tag a release in Git (e.g. v1.0.0)
4. Build XCFramework from that tag
5. Create NPM package
6. Test the built packages
7. Release to customers

## Notes

- SwiftMetroTEST = Source code (Swift Package on GitHub)
- SwifMetro-PerfectWorking = Server + Dashboard
- Current working commit: 0f82918
- Server running on port 8081
- Dashboard at http://localhost:3001
