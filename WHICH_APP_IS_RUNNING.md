```

**NOT a DMG version** - it's the actual installed Electron app!

---

## üîç Evidence

## üì¶ How It Works

### What Happened:
1. **DMG was created** (October 6th)
2. **DMG was opened** (sometime before Oct 9th)
3. **App was dragged to /Applications/** (October 9th, 8:22 PM)
4. **App is now installed and running** (currently running)

### What's Running Now:
```
SwifMetro.app
    ‚Üì
Built from: electron-main.js + swifmetro-dashboard.html + swifmetro-server.js
    ‚Üì
Contains: app.asar (52 MB packed archive with all files)
    ‚Üì
Running on: PID 542 (main), 759 (GPU), 760 (network), 13395 (renderer)
```

## üîÑ Is It Using Local Files?

### NO! It's Self-Contained

The app in `/Applications/SwifMetro.app` has its own **packed files** inside:

```
/Applications/SwifMetro.app/
    Contents/
        Resources/
            app.asar (52 MB) ‚Üê All code is packed in here
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ electron-main.js
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ swifmetro-dashboard.html
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ swifmetro-server.js
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
```

**The app is NOT reading from your SwifMetro-PerfectWorking folder!**

---

## üîß What This Means

### If You Edit Local Files:
```bash
cd /Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/SwifMetro-PerfectWorking
# Edit swifmetro-dashboard.html
```

**The running app WON'T see these changes!**

### Why?
The installed app has its **OWN copy** of all files packed inside `app.asar`.

---

## üìù To Update The Installed App

### Option 1: Rebuild The Entire App
```bash
cd /Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/SwifMetro-PerfectWorking
npx electron-builder --mac
# This creates a new DMG
# Open DMG and reinstall app
```

### Option 2: Replace Files Inside App
```bash
# Extract current app.asar
npx asar extract /Applications/SwifMetro.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar /tmp/app-extracted

# Copy your updated files
cp swifmetro-dashboard.html /tmp/app-extracted/

# Repack
npx asar pack /tmp/app-extracted /Applications/SwifMetro.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar

# Restart app
```

### Option 3: Test Locally First
```bash
# Don't update the installed app yet
# Just test your changes locally:
open swifmetro-dashboard.html  # Open in browser
node swifmetro-server.js        # Run server locally
```

## üéØ Summary

**Question:** Is it a DMG version or local Electron app?

**Answer:** It's the **INSTALLED** Electron app from /Applications/

**Details:**
- ‚úÖ Running from: `/Applications/SwifMetro.app`
- ‚úÖ Installed: October 9th, 8:22 PM
- ‚úÖ PID: 542 (main process)
- ‚úÖ Self-contained: Has own files in app.asar
- ‚ùå NOT the DMG (DMG is just sitting there)
