# SwifMetro Setup Guide - Step by Step

**⏱️ Setup Time:** 5 minutes  
**✅ Difficulty:** Easy  
**🎯 Result:** Wireless iOS logging dashboard working perfectly

---

## 🚀 The Magic 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Start the Server (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/SwifMetro-PerfectWorking
node swifmetro-server.js
```

**You'll see:**
```
🚀 SWIFMETRO SERVER
📡 Starting on port 8081...
✅ Server is running!
✅ Database tables initialized
```

✅ **Server is ready!** Leave this terminal open.

**IMPORTANT:** Use `node swifmetro-server.js` (production server with dashboard support), NOT the simple server in `server/` folder!

---

### Step 2: Open SwifMetro Dashboard (10 seconds)

**Just double-click:**
```
/Applications/SwifMetro.app
```

**Or from terminal:**
```bash
open /Applications/SwifMetro.app
```

**First time only:** Enter license key:
```
SWIF-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO
```

**You'll see:**
- Beautiful dark dashboard
- "Connected" indicator (green)
- "Waiting for logs from your iOS device..."

✅ **Dashboard is ready!**

---

### Step 3: Run Your iOS App (2 minutes)

**Open Xcode:**
```bash
cd /Users/conlanainsworth/Desktop/StickerPlanNEW
open StickerPlanNative.xcodeproj
```

**Press Cmd+R to run**

**Instantly see:**
- Terminal: `📱 New device connected: iPhone 16 Pro`
- Dashboard: Logs streaming in real-time!
- All print() statements captured automatically!

✅ **DONE! You're now debugging wirelessly!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Why It Works So Well

### The Architecture is Brilliant

**1. Zero Configuration**
- App auto-discovers server
- Server auto-broadcasts to dashboard
- Everything just connects!

**2. Automatic Print Capture**
```swift
// You don't need to change ANY code!
print("This appears automatically!")  // ✅ Captured
print("So does this!")                // ✅ Captured
NSLog("Even NSLog works!")            // ✅ Captured
```

The Swift client uses `dup2()` to redirect stdout/stderr - **pure genius!**

**3. WebSocket Protocol**
```
iOS App ←→ WebSocket ←→ Server ←→ WebSocket ←→ Dashboard
         Port 8081              Port 8081
```

Everything happens in **real-time** with <10ms latency!

**4. Beautiful Dashboard**
- Logs auto-scroll
- Color-coded by type
- Search & filter instantly
- Dark/Light theme
- Export to file
- Copy to clipboard

No setup needed - it just works!

## 📱 Adding SwifMetro to ANY iOS App

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

**1. Add Swift Package**

In Xcode:
```
File → Add Package Dependencies
```

Enter URL:
```
https://github.com/SwifMetro/SwiftMetroTEST
```

Select `Branch: main` → Add Package

---

**2. Update Your AppDelegate.swift**

Add this at the top:
```swift
import SwifMetro
```

Add this in your `init()`:
```swift
@main
struct YourApp: App {
    init() {
        #if DEBUG
        #if targetEnvironment(simulator)
        SwifMetroClient.shared.start(
            serverIP: "127.0.0.1",
            licenseKey: "SWIF-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO"
        )
        #else
        // For real device, use your Mac's IP address
        SwifMetroClient.shared.start(
            serverIP: "192.168.0.100",  // ← Change to your Mac's IP
            licenseKey: "SWIF-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO"
        )
        #endif
        #endif
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** Find your Mac's IP:
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

---

**3. Update Info.plist**

Right-click `Info.plist` → Open As → Source Code

Add this:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
    <key>NSAllowsLocalNetworking</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

**Why?** Allows WebSocket connections in debug mode.

---

**4. Build & Run!**

Press **Cmd+R**

**Instantly see:**
- ✅ Connection message in dashboard
- ✅ All print() statements streaming
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Beautiful color-coded logs

**That's it! No cables, no Xcode console!** 🎉

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Emoji for Visual Scanning

```swift
print("🚀 App launched")
print("👤 User logged in")
print("📁 File opened")
print("💾 Data saved")
print("🔍 Search started")
print("🎉 Task completed")
```

Logs are **instantly recognizable** in dashboard!

---

### Tip 2: Structure Your Logs

```swift
print("=== AUTHENTICATION ===")
print("Checking credentials...")
print("✅ User authenticated")
print("======================")
```

Easy to find sections in log stream!

---

### Tip 3: Log Object Descriptions

```swift
let user = User(name: "John", age: 30)
print("👤 User: \(user)")

let items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
print("📦 Items: \(items)")
```

See data structure in real-time!

---

### Tip 4: Use Search Effectively

**Search for:**
- Function names: `viewDidLoad`
- Variable names: `userId`
- Keywords: `network`, `error`, `success`
- Emoji: `🚀`, `❌`, `✅`

Instant filtering!

---

### Tip 5: Export Before Crashes

If app about to crash:
1. Click **💾 Export** quickly
2. Save logs
3. Send to team
4. Debug faster!

## 🎓 Learning More

### Understanding the Tech

**1. dup2() Magic**

SwifMetro uses UNIX `dup2()` to redirect stdout:
```swift
// Redirect stdout to our pipe
dup2(stdoutPipe[1], STDOUT_FILENO)

// Now ALL print() goes to our pipe!
// We read it and send to server
```

**Genius!** No code changes needed!

---

**2. WebSocket Protocol**

```
Device → Server: "Here's a log!"
Server → All Dashboards: "Broadcast this log!"
```

Real-time, bidirectional, instant!

---

**3. JSON Messages**

Everything is JSON:
```json
{
  "type": "log",
  "message": "App launched!",
  "deviceId": "ABC123",
  "deviceName": "iPhone 16 Pro",
  "timestamp": "01:23:45"
}
```

Easy to parse, extend, debug!
