- [ ] Logs from both devices display correctly
- [ ] Device names/IDs distinguishable
- [ ] Disconnect one device (other continues working)

---

## üîê License System Testing

### Trial System
- [ ] Delete existing trial: `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/SwifMetro/trial.json`
- [ ] Start SwifMetro (should show license prompt)
- [ ] Activate 7-day trial
- [ ] Verify trial.json created with correct expiration date
- [ ] Close and reopen SwifMetro (trial persists)
- [ ] Verify trial shows remaining days

### Demo License
- [ ] Enter demo key: `SWIF-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO`
- [ ] Verify unlimited access granted
- [ ] Verify no trial expiration warnings
- [ ] Close and reopen (demo key remembered)

### Invalid License
- [ ] Enter invalid key: `INVALID-KEY-TEST`
- [ ] Verify error message shown
- [ ] Verify cannot proceed without valid key or trial
- [ ] Error message clear and helpful

### Hardware ID Binding
- [ ] Check hardware ID generated: `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Hardware UUID"`
- [ ] Verify hardware ID hashed in trial.json (sha256, 16 chars)
- [ ] Copy trial.json to another Mac (should fail to validate)

---

## üåê Network & Connectivity Testing

### WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Dashboard connects to server (ws://localhost:8081)
- [ ] Connection survives server restart
- [ ] Connection survives dashboard restart
- [ ] Multiple dashboards can connect simultaneously

### Firewall Testing
- [ ] Works with macOS firewall enabled
- [ ] Prompts for network access permission (if required)
- [ ] iOS simulator can reach Mac server
- [ ] Physical iOS device can reach Mac server (same WiFi)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Start dashboard without server (shows connection error)
- [ ] Start server without dashboard (no crash)
- [ ] Kill server while dashboard running (dashboard shows disconnected)
- [ ] Reconnect server (dashboard auto-reconnects)

---

## üéØ Cross-Platform Testing (If Applicable)

- [ ] Test on macOS Ventura (13.x)
- [ ] Test on macOS Sonoma (14.x)
- [ ] Test on macOS Sequoia (15.x)

## üîí Security Verification

- [ ] No secrets in published code (.env, API keys, passwords)
- [ ] .npmignore excludes CONFIDENTIAL/ folder
- [ ] .npmignore excludes .env* files
- [ ] .npmignore excludes *.pem, *.key files
- [ ] Run security scan: `grep -r "API_KEY\|SECRET\|PASSWORD" . --exclude-dir=node_modules`
- [ ] Verify no database URLs in code
- [ ] Verify no Stripe keys in code

---

## üö® Edge Case Testing

- [ ] Start dashboard before server (should show error, not crash)
- [ ] Start multiple dashboard instances (should all work)
- [ ] Send 10,000+ logs rapidly (performance test)
- [ ] Disconnect iOS device mid-stream (graceful handling)
- [ ] Enter extremely long log message (>10KB)
- [ ] Enter Unicode/emoji in logs (displays correctly)
- [ ] Test with no internet connection (local features work)

---

## üìä Final Verification

- [ ] All tests passed with no critical errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable on target hardware
- [ ] No console errors or warnings (check DevTools)
- [ ] User experience smooth and professional
- [ ] Ready to publish to npm
- [ ] Ready to make GitHub repository public

---

## üöÄ Ready to Launch?

If ALL checkboxes above are checked:

**Next steps:**
1. Go to `LAUNCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Follow Phase 2 (Public Launch)
3. Publish to npm: `npm publish`
4. Make GitHub public: Settings ‚Üí Change visibility ‚Üí Make public

---

## üêõ If Tests Fail

### Dashboard won't start
- Check Electron installed: `ls node_modules/.bin/electron`
- Reinstall: `npm install`
- Check logs: Look for error in terminal

### iOS won't connect
- Verify server running on port 8081
- Check iOS app server URL (must match Mac IP)
- Check firewall settings
- Try localhost first, then WiFi IP

### License prompt doesn't appear
- Check electron-main.js loaded correctly
- Delete trial.json and restart
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Logs not appearing
- Verify WebSocket connection in dashboard console
- Check server receiving connections (terminal output)
- Verify iOS client sending data (Xcode console)
